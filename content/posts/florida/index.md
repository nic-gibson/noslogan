We've been on Florida on holiday (vacation?) with Em's dad and his wife. We visited the theme parks, they were OK. Disney is much more mellow than Universal, there are some great rides at both but Owen and I (the ride fans) like roller coaster rich environments best really. 

We also went to the Kennedy Space Center. It's been thirty something years since I was last there and I was a bit bemused to find it has become theme parked. 

_But…_, we decided to go kayaking to get away from tourist Florida. Just up the road from where were staying (in American terms - it was 30 minutes' drive) there's a place called [The Paddling Center](https://www.paddlingcenter.com) who do guided tours of Shingle Creek as well as simple kayak rental. We did the two hour tour and it was the best part of our entire Florida trip. Our guide (Josh) was amazing, the scenary was beautiful and younger child discovered something new – he loves kayaking.

We loved it so much that we went back two days later and rented kayaks for two hours so we could explore the creek downstream as well.
