I was helping my son mow my neighbour's garden yesterday when something flew past me. My first thought was “that was a _huge_ wasp” but I didn't see it well. Then I saw movement and realised it was a dragonfly. I'm rather fond of dragonflies. This lovely creature let me take photos of her (I *think* it's a female but it could be an immature male). [She's a broad-bodied chaser](https://british-dragonflies.org.uk/species/broad-bodied-chaser/). I imagine that she hatched from our neighbour's pond.
