This recipe is so easy. I think I originally got it from a cookbook that I ordered from Carnation. The condensed milk makes the cookies softer. You can use almost any nuts. I've used pecans, hazelnuts, almonds and walnuts in the past.

## Ingredients

* 225g softened unsalted butter
* 225g caster sugar
* 170g condensed milk
* 250g self-raising flour
* 100g chopped up dark chocolate (quite big chunks)
* 100g chopped pecans

## Method

1. Cream the butter and sugar together; when creamed add the condensed milk
2. Mix in the flour
3. Add the nuts & chocolate, mixing through
4. Split into two and roll each into a sausage about 25cm long
5. Wrap in cling film and refrigerate for at least an hour (up to a week is fine)
6. Heat oven to 170c (fan oven) or 180c (conventional oven)
7. Cover two baking trays with baking parchment
8. Unwrap and slice up into fairly thick rings and place on the trays 
9. Bake for 15 minutes or so (they may get golden brown a little sooner)
10. Feed hordes
