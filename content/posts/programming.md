I've been thinking about the things that I use to do my job. There's the obvious things like a web browser (I *like* Safari but I *use* Chrome). A lot has changed since because I've gone from a job where writing code was most of my job at MarkLogic to a job where writing code is something that I might do in order to get something in my job done (at Redis). 

As I settle in at Redis, I've been setting up my environment. It feels pretty similar to what I've used before although I don't need any XML tools at all. I've never actually written down what I use nor have I really thought about justifying to myself why I use the tools I use. 

The suite of software I actually use day to day has got smaller in many ways. By that, I mean that much much more of it lives in a browser these days, particularly at Redis. Apart from a browser, I don't actually need any other software than the three (four if you count fonts) below. 

*Obviously* ('cos I *am* a techie), I use git, python, ssh and a whole slew of command line tools but I tend to think of those as the things I used *in* my working environment. 

## iTerm2

I've only just switched to iTerm2. I've been an Apple Terminal user for ever despite friends and colleagues telling me I should switch. I tend to use solarized light themes. I found one for iTerm2 [on github](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes). 

Fundamentally, the panes are ridiculously useful when I'm looking at a cluster. 

## Visual Studio Code

Once upon a time I lived in vim. My fingers are still programmed to use it. It was the first thing I checked was installed on any new system I used.

A few years ago a colleague released VS Code integrations for MarkLogic in VS Code. At the time I was trying to get into using IntelliJ ecause it had a good MarkLogic plugin. But.. being that sort of person (geek/techie/whatever) I thought that I would try this new editor. I'm not a Microsoft fan (OK, I have always liked SQL Server and I made a fair amount of income from extending Visual Basic years ago) but it was worth a try. 

Step forward a few years and it's my primary editor whatever operating system I happen to be running. I've got the hang of its git integration too. That might actually end my love affair with Tower as a git client. 

## zsh & oh-my-zsh

I've used zsh for many years [\@Samoth](https://twitter.com/TheSamoth) talked me into trying when I worked with him at Cocoon Internet. Nowadays, I find that [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) automates most of the customisations I used anyway. 

There's no real justification for using zsh except that "I'm used to it and productive with it". But that'll do. 

## Fonts

I've also got into the habit of using a coding specialised font with ligatures. I like [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode), ymmv. I use it as both my terminal and editing font.
