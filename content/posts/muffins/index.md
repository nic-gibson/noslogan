This makes about 20-24 muffins. They are best when you eat them absolutely fresh. Just make sure they are cooked _enough_. They aren't like the one you buy in the supermarket - they're a bit more dense. You can cook them until they start to brown.

## Ingredients

* 200g sourdough starter
* 40g maple syrup (or honey if you must)
* 480g milk (it works best if you weigh it)
* 720 plain flour
* 10g fine sea salt
* 40g polenta flour (sprinkling - don't put it in the mixture)

## Method

I do this last thing at night so I can make them for breakfast.

1. Put the starter and all other ingredients together in a large bowl (not the polenta). Mix until well combined
2. Leave it for an hour.
3. Turn out of the bowl onto a floured surface and kneed for about 5 minutes (I've tried this in a mix and it doesn't really work)
4. Leave somewhere warm for about 12 hours. It *should* rise and double. 
5. In the morning, take the dough, flatten it onto a floured surface. You want it to be around 2cm thick. 
6. Take a couple of baking trays, line them with baking parchment and cover that with polenta flour (be generous - it sticks)
7. Use a ring of some sort (about 8cm) to cut out rings, put them onto the polenta flour.
8. Leave it for an hour.
9. Heat a couple of cast iron pans on the hob to a medium heat.
10. Place the muffins onto the pan.
11. Turn over after about 3-4 minutes. Cook for about the same time. I usually check by picking one up, and gently tearing the side. If it's bubbly and dry, it's cooked.
