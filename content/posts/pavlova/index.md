I love pavlova. There seem to be *so* many different recipe variations for the meringue. I've tried loads but I always come back to this one. My mum gave this one to me about twenty years ago. This recipe has never let me down. I've tried ones from cookbooks and the meringue just hasn't worked as well. This works. 

The raspberry and passion fruit is our addition; you can use any fruit you like. 

We tend to use the left over yolks to make ice cream 🍦

## Pavlova

### Ingredients

* 6 egg whites
* 350g caster sugar
* 2 tsp cornflour
* 2 tsp white wine vinegar
* 425ml double cream
* Two or three ripe passion fruit depending on size
* 250g raspberries

### Method

1. Preheat oven to 170°C (about 160°C for a fan oven)/325F/Gas 3 
2. Split the passion fruit and rub them through a sieve. Leave it so the juice can seep through. 
3. Whisk egg whites until stiff (around 4 minutes with my stand mixer)
4. Add and beat in half the sugar
5. Add the remaining sugar, cornflour and vinegar slowly whilst beating and keep beating until the mix is stiff and glossy (another 3 or 4 minutes in my mixer)
6. Cover a flat baking sheet with baking parchment and spread the meringue in a circle (drawing a circle on the parchment helps) about 25cm across. Make slight dip in the middle, sprinkle with caster sugar and bake it for about 30–40 minutes. It's cooked when you can easily separate the baking parchment and the meringue. 
7. Leave to cool completely 
8. Whip the cream lightly — you don't want it too stiff. 
9. Mix about 2/3 or the passion fruit juice into the cream and then spread the cream over the cooked meringue.
10. Spread the raspberries over the cream.
11. Just before serving sprinkle the remaining passion fruit juice over the raspberries.
