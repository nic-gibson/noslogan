I always forget how much of each different type of yeast to use. An aide memoire…

Fresh Yeast

: Let's take this as the base - 10g of fresh yeast. You can just mix it with the flour but keep it separate from the salt.

Dried Active Yeast:

: We need about 75% of the amount of fresh yeast. We need to activate it with a little water (dissolve it in a small amount of tepid water). So, for our 10gms of of fresh yeast, _we'd use 7–8g of dried active yeast_. There's no real need to keep it separate from the salt but I tend to add it with the water.

Fast Acting/Easy/Quick Yeast

: We need about 50% of the amount of fresh yeast. So, for our 10gms of of fresh yeast, _we'd use 5g of fast acting yeast_. It can be added straight to the flour and you really don't need to keep it separate from the salt.
