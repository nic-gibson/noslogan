My name is Nic Gibson and I am a geek. I don't plan to join Codeaholics Anonymous because I like what I do for a living. 

These days I work for [Redis](https://redis.com) as a Corporate Technical Account Manager – that is, I try to ensure that Redis customers are happy Redis customers and stay that way.

I spent the twenty odd years before that doing things that involved XML, initially in publishing and then (working for MarkLogic) in financial services. 

There may be more to say about me but I haven't had time to say it.
