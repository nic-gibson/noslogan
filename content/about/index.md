My name is Nic Gibson and I am a geek. This is, in general, a good thing 

These days I work for [Redis](https://redis.io) as a Senior Technical Account Manager – that is, I try to ensure that Redis customers are happy Redis customers and stay that way.

I spent the twenty odd years before that doing things that involved XML, initially in publishing and then (working for MarkLogic) in financial services. 

In the real part of my life I cook, run, swim, normal stuff. 

There may be more to say about me but I haven't had time to say it.
